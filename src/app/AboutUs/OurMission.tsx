            <p className="size-[50%]">At Handcrafted Haven, we believe every product tells a story—of tradition, 
                artistry, and care. Our mission is to bridge cultures through beautifully 
                crafted goods that honor the hands and hearts behind them. We strive to 
                create a space where ethical choices meet elegant design, and where shopping 
                becomes an act of empowerment—for creators, communities, and conscious consumers.
